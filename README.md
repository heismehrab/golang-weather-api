# golang-weather-api

Developed to give you a basic and easy example of 
calling APIs and handle their responses.

I used an API to get weather data of your selected city,
The API needs a token/key which I put mine, you can use your own one and replace it in [here](./config/wheather_data.go).

Feel free if have a better idea for develop/restructure codes (via pull requests).
